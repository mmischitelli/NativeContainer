# NativeContainer
Simple C++ implementation of a dependency injection container as seen on my [blog post](https://mmischitelli.github.io/2019/11/14/lifetime-managers/).

## Instructions
The tests need [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) to run. After having downloaded and unzipped Boost somewhere on your drive, clone my repo. Open the solution and modify the NativeContainerTests project by adding the Boost folder in the C++ include directories.
